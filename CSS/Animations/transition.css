    CSS Transitions are used to define the transition between two states of an element
    By default transitions happen instantly.
    Transition is controlled using four properties:
        transition-duration: duration it will take for the transition
        transition-property: property to apply the transition on like: background, padding, width, etc.
                                by default transition applies to all properties or we can use "all" to apply to all
        transition-delay: defines the amount of time before the transition starts
        transition-timing-function: defines how the transition utilize it's time.
                                    e.g.: linear(default): keep the transition consistent
                                            ease-in: make the transition starts slow & pickup speed by the end
                                            ease-out: starts fast & slows down by the end
                                            ease-in-out: start slow, pickups speed & then ends slow
                Timing Function doesn't affect the duration but utilize it in different ways
                We can also write Timing-Functions manually using cubic-bezier() function, this value can be generated using websites like: https://cubic-bezier.com/
    
    transition property is the shorthand for above 4 properties. Written in the following order:
        transition: transition-property | transition-duration | transition-timing-function | transition-delay

        we can apply different transitions to different properties by separating each set of using commas
            e.g.- transition: background 2000ms 5000ms, transform 5000ms 5000ms;

    [Note: It is recommended to apply transition on the original state of element like .box instead of applying it of .box:hover.
            This is because if the transition is applied on state changing selectors like :hover the transition doesn't work for the reverse i.e., hovering out]

.box {
    width: 300px;
    height: 300px;
    background-color: dodgerblue;
    /*
    transition-duration: 2000ms;
    transition-property: transform;
    transition-delay: 2000ms;
    transition-timing-function: ease-in;
    The above can be written as follows
    */
    transition: transform 2000ms ease-in 2000ms;
}
.box:hover {
    background: crimson;
    transform: rotate(45deg);
}
