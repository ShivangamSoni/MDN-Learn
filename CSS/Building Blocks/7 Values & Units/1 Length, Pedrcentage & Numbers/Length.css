    Lengths are divided into Absolute & Relative Units
    Absolute Units: Aren't relative to anything and always remain same
        Unit    Name                    Equivalent to
        cm      Centimeters             1cm = 38px = 25/64in
        mm      Millimeters             1mm = 1/10th of 1cm
        Q       Quarter-Millimeters     1Q = 140th of 1cm
        in      Inches                  1in = 2.54cm = 96px
        pc      Picas                   1pc = 1/6th of 1in
        pt      Points                  1pt = 1/72th of 1in
        px      Pixels                  1px = 1/96th of 1in
    
    Relative Units: These length units are relative to something else.
        Unit    Relative to
        em      Font size of the parent, in the case of typographical properties like font-size, and font size of the element itself, in the case of other properties like width.
        rem     Font size of the root element.
        vw      1% of the viewport's width.
        vh      1% of the viewport's height.
        vmin    1% of the viewport's smaller dimension.
        vmax    1% of the viewport's larger dimension.
        lh      Line height of the element.
        ex      x-height of the element's font.
        ch      The advance measure (width) of the glyph "0" of the element's font.
    
    Example below sets
        box with .px to 200px
        box with .vw to 10vw which is 10% of viewports width
        box with .em to 10em which is 10* the parents font-size (in this case 25px)

    em vs rem
    em means parent's fonts-size.
        The following style will set <li> elements inside the <ul> with a class of em to be 1.3 times its parent's font-size
        So each successive level of nesting gets progressively larger.
    
    rem means root elements  font-size.
        The following style will set <li> elements inside the <ul> with a class of rem to be 1.3 times its root's(html) font-size
        So each successive level of nesting will remain the same size.
