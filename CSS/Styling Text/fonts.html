                FONT: Properties related to font like color, size, style, etc.
                color sets the color of text

                font-family applies the specified font

                font-size sets size of font

                font-style: used to turn italic text on or off
                        Values: normal, italic & oblique
                
                font-weight: sets how bold the text is
                        Values: normal, bold, bolder, lighter, 100-900 (Numeric value scan be used for a finer control aver boldness)
                
                text-transform: allows you to set your font to be transformed
                        Values: none, uppercase, lowercase, capitalize, full-width (transforms all glyphs to be written inside a fixed-width square, similar to a monospace font, allowing aligning of, e.g., Latin characters along with Asian language glyphs)
                
                text-decoration: sets or un-sets text-decoration on fonts
                        Values: none, underline, overline, line-through
                    text-decoration can take multiple values like: text-decoration: underline overline solid red; text-decoration: underline line-through double blue;
                    text-decoration is a shorthand for:
                        text-decoration-line
                        text-decoration-style: solid, double, dotted, dashed, wavy
                        text-decoration-color

                text-shadow: drop shadows to your text
                    It take upto 4 values like, text-shadow: 2px 3px 5px blue;
                    -Horizontal Offset(X-axis): +ve values move the shadow Right & -ve towards left. This value is required
                    -Vertical Offset(Y-axis): +ve moves down & -ve moves up. This value is also requires
                    -Blur Radius: higher the radius more widely the shadow is dispersed. id no value given it defaults to 0, which means no blur
                    -Color: base color of shadow. if not given it defaults to color property of the element

                    We can also add multiple shadows by separating each shadow values using comma like,
                    text-shadow: 4px 4px 1px blue, -4px -4px 2px red;

                
                TEXT LAYOUT: properties that affect spacing & other layout features
                text-align: used to control how text is aligned within its containing content box
                        Values: left, right, center, justify (justify can make the text look weird if there are a lot of long words so, we can use hyphens property to break long words e.g.- hyphens: auto or manual)
                
                line-height: set the height of each line.
                        Values: It can take most lengths & size units but mostly we use unitless values
                                unitless vales basically multiply the current line-height & font-size to adjust
                                recommended line-height is around 1.5-2 (double spaced)
                
                letter-spacing: sets spacing between letters
                        Values: most length & size units
                
                word-spacing: sets spacing between words
                        Values: most length & size units
                
                
            */

            html {
                /*
                    Child Elements inherit the font-size, hence almost all text elements that don't have any special default styling default to it's parents size
                        Default size to html document is 16px
                        mostly we use px, em & rem to set font-size
                        To have easier calculations of rem we can set the html font-size to 10px
                        so now if I want to set the font size of p to 22px I can just use the calculation 22/10 = 2.2 & set the  size to 2.2rem
                */
                font-size: 10px;
            }

            h1 {
                font-size: 5rem;
                text-transform: uppercase;
                text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px red, 2px 2px 1px red;
                text-align: center;
            }

            h1 + p {
                font-weight: bold;
            }

            p {
                font-size: 1.5rem;

                color: red;

                line-height: 1.6;

                /*
                    Font-Family apply the specified font if it's available on the Users Machine
                    else it falls back to browser default

                    Some Web-Safe Fonts that are available on almost every OS are
                        -Arial (san-serif)
                        -Courier New (monospace)
                        -Georgia (serif)
                        -Times New Roman (serif)
                        -Trebuchet MS (san-serif)
                        -Verdana (san-serif)
                    
                    Default Fonts: CSS defines five generic names for fonts. These are very generic & font-faces used for them varies between Browsers & OS
                                    The browser tries it's best to provide a font that looks appropriate. 
                        -serif: Fonts that have serifs (the flourishes and other small details you see at the ends of the strokes in some typefaces)
                        -san-serif: Fonts that don't have serifs
                        -monospace: Fonts where every character has some width, typically used in code listings
                        -cursive: Fonts that are intended to emulate handwriting, with flowing, connected strokes.
                        -fantasy: Fonts that are intended to be decorative

                        serif, san-serif & monospace are safe to use & in most browsers it provide predictable results
                        whereas, cursive & fantasy are less predictable & can provide extremely varied results depending upon OS & Browser

                    Font-Stacks: Since we can't guarantee the availability of the fonts, we can supply a font-stack so that the browser has multiple fonts it can choose from
                                    this is done by providing multiple font-names & generic types in font-family by separating them using commas
                                font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, san-serif;
                                In the example above if Trebuchet MS is not available then Verdana is uses,
                                                     if Verdana is also not available then the browser will use its default sans-serif font.

        <h1>Tommy the cat</h1>

        <p>Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...</p>

        <p>
            Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley
            rat had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this
            urban predator â€” Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did.
