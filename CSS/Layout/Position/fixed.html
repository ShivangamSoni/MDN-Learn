        <h1>Fixed Positioning</h1>
        <p>I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new lines below me.</p>

        <p class="positioned">
            By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and our height is as tall as our child content. Our total width and height is
            our content + padding + border width/height.
        </p>

        <p>We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.</p>

        <p>
            inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if
            there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements
            <span>wrap onto a new line if possible â€” like this one containing text</span>, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image
            will do: <img src="long.jpg" />
        </p>
